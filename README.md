# Task-03
Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength

# Password Complexity Checker
A Password Complexity Checker is a tool designed to evaluate the strength and security of passwords based on various criteria. The goal of such a tool is to help users create robust passwords that are difficult to guess or crack, thereby enhancing their overall security online. Here’s a detailed explanation of how a Password Complexity Checker works and the benefits it provides.

# How It Works:
Length Check: The password must be at least 8 characters long. Longer passwords are generally more secure, so additional points might be awarded for passwords that are 12 characters or longer.
Uppercase Check: The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
Lowercase Check: The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
Digit Check: The password must contain at least one digit.
Special Character Check: The password must contain at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()). 
The combination and variety of these characters increase the password's complexity, making it harder for malicious actors to guess or brute-force the password.

Output:
Feedback: The tool provides specific feedback on what’s missing in the password and evaluates its overall strength as weak, moderate, or strong.

How to Use:
Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., password_strength_tool.py).
Run the script.
Enter your password when prompted.
Read the feedback on the password's strength.
This tool can be easily extended or integrated into other applications to enforce password policies and improve security.
